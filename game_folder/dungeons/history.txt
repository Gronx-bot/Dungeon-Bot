long Abandoned by its creators
long Abandoned due to a plague
Conquered by invaders some time ago
its Creators were destroyed by attacking raiders
its Creators were destroyed by discovery made within the site
its Creators were destroyed by internal conflict
its Creators were destroyed by magical catastrophe
its Creators were destroyed by natural disaster
cursed by the gods and shunned
the Site of a great miracle
